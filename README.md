# Lust Watch

Lust Watch is a World of Warcraft addon that tracks and announces when players or pets use abilities like Bloodlust or Heroism in group or raid settings.

## Features

- **Language Support**: Compatible with multiple game languages for seamless functionality across regions.
- **Comprehensive Detection**: Tracks Bloodlust/Heroism activations from players, pets, and items with similar effects.
- **Optimized Announcing**: When multiple players in the same group or raid have Lust Watch, the addon designates one player as the announcer, preventing duplicate messages in chat.

## Usage

Lust Watch operates automatically in the background. If you're the designated announcer, Lust Watch will broadcast in the chat whenever Bloodlust/Heroism abilities or items are activated.
